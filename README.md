Module 19 Assignment - Text Editor (PWA)



# Text Editor - PWA

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

In this challenge we worked with a PWA, or progressive web app, and through caching, allowed the app to run while offline. We were tasked with linking babel in our code to give the browser the ability to read ES6 syntax. I started to gain a better understanding of how caching works on the backend, and the proper requirements that are needed to allow the app to run in a browser with an active internet connection.
